As a travler I want to see the weather outlook for multiple cities so that I can plan a trip accordingly.

## Criteria
Given a weather dashboard with form inputs,

- When I search for a city then I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history.
- When I view current weather conditions for that city then I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index.
- When I view the UV index then I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe.
- When I view future weather conditions for that city then am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity.
- When I click on a city in the search history then I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city.
